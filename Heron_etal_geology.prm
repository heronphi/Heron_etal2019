# Velocity on boundaries characterized by functions
# In the models presented here, we apply a prescribed boundary velocity on the north and south boundaries, and tangential velocity boundary condition on the west, east and base walls of the model, and a free surface on top. We have modelled the Cartesian 3D box large enough so that deformation driven from the scarring is not influenced by the tangential boundary conditions (as described below).
# The prescribed boundary condition on the north wall is a 1 cm/yr convergence for the lithosphere (120 km) and a return flow of -0.6 cm/yr for the bottom 200 km of the box. In between, the velocity tapers from 1 cm/yr to 0 cm/yr from 120 km to 225 km depth, and from 0 cm/yr to -0.6 cm/yr from 200 km to 400 km depth. The reverse is applied to the west wall, with 1 cm/yr compression for the lithosphere. After extensive testing, we found this boundary condition to provide stable solutions.

# #   D.S. Chapman (1986), "Thermal gradients in the continental crust",
# #   Geological Society of London Special Publications, v.24, p.63-70.
# # The initial constraints are:
# #   Layer Surface Temperature - upper crust (ts1) = 273 K; 
# #   Temperature - base of upper crust (ts2) = 681.5714
# #                               mantle      (ts3) = 823 K;

# #   Heat Production - upper crust (A) = 1.5e-6 W/m^3; 
# #   Thermal Conductivity - upper crust (k1) = 2.5 (W/(m K)); 
# #                          lower crust (k2) = 2.5 (W/(m K)); 
# #                          mantle      (k3) = 3.3 (W/(m K));
# #                          asthenosphere (k4) = 39.25 (W/(m K));
# # To satisfy these constraints, the following values are required:
# #   Layer Surface Heat Flow - upper crust (qs1) = 0.065357 W/m^2; 
# #                             lower crust (qs2) = 0.035357 W/m^2;

# #
# # Table DR2 gives the values for the thermal constraints required to generate the geotherm. As described in Naliboff and Buiter (2015), we use a high conductivity in the asthenosphere to maintain the high adiabat in the layer, and to generate a constant heat flux into the lithosphere (Pysklywec and Beaumont, 2004).
