This is the output folder for Model ML 
The restart files have been removed for space, and they wouldn't work unless used on the specific cluster. 

The models were ran on HPC SciNet, Niagara Cluster. 


The ASPECT code can be downloaded from https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/releases/tag/v2.0.0. 


# ASPECT Input file for Model ML for the publication: 
# # The input file is based heavily on the ASPECT cookbook 'Continental Extension' which was developed by Prof John Naliboff. The authors thank Prof Naliboff for his work.  
# # 
# # The majority of the models were completed with the following ASPECT specifications:
# --     . version 2.0.0-pre (master, 572f967)
# --     . using deal.II 9.0.0-pre (master, b6f30fb)
# --     . using Trilinos 12.10.1
# --     . using p4est 1.1.0
# --     . running in OPTIMIZED mode
# --     . running with 400 MPI processes
